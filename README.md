# IBM-Project


Citizen AI – Intelligent Citizen Engagement Platform

📌 About the Project

This project was developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan (NM) program.
It demonstrates how AI language models can be used for citizen engagement, providing intelligent, conversational responses to queries through a simple Gradio interface.

The application uses the IBM Granite AI model (hosted on Hugging Face) to process and generate answers.
